This study guide was created to help create a central location for my notekeeping during the bootcamp. I can use this to refer back to my notes, and also add more notes and sections along the way. Currently, there are notes for sections such as HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript.

If the DevTool console is opened, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from the prework and randomly choose one topic to study first.
